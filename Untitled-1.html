            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Satnam Singh and I am currently a student at Algonquin college at CDI campus, pursuing
                 a degree in Web Development. I have always been fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and
                  how it shapes our daily lives. My journey into web development started when I took my first coding class 
                  in high school, and I was immediately hooked.
            </p>

                Apart from studies, i have a wide range of hobbies. I enjoy reading and exploring nature,which provides a
                 refreshing balance to the time which i spend on studies and computers. I am also an avid reader,particularly
                  of science fiction and fantasy novels, which fuel my imagination and creativity. I am also a sports person
                   and i usally play football on weekends which helps me to keep my body fit and away from several ailments.
